# PiRacer Control System

This document explains the signal flow and control architecture for the PiRacer autonomous vehicle system.

## System Architecture

The PiRacer control system consists of four main components:
- **Gamepad Input**: Shawnpad gamepad for user control
- **Raspberry Pi Processing**: Python script for input processing and command generation
- **Waveshare Periphery Board**: I2C PWM controllers for signal generation
- **PiRacer Actuators**: Servo and DC motors for physical control

## Detailed Signal Flow Explanation

### 1. User Input (Shawnpad Gamepad) üéÆ

**Turning Left/Right:** When you push the **left joystick horizontally** (left for left turn, right for right turn), the gamepad generates an analog signal for the X-axis.

**Throttle Forward/Backward:** When you push the **right joystick vertically** (up for forward, down for backward), the gamepad generates an analog signal for the Y-axis.

### 2. Raspberry Pi Reads Gamepad Events (via `evdev`) üíª

- The gamepad transmits these analog signals to the Raspberry Pi.
- The `piracer-gamepad-control.py` script, running on the Raspberry Pi, uses the `evdev` library to continuously read raw input events from the gamepad's device file (e.g., `/dev/input/event0`).
- It specifically detects `EV_ABS` (absolute axis) events:
  - `ABS_X` for the left joystick's horizontal movement (steering).
  - `ABS_RY` (or similar, depending on your gamepad) for the right joystick's vertical movement (throttle).

### 3. Maps Input to Control Values üìè

- The raw integer values from `evdev` (typically -32768 to 32767 for joysticks) are **mapped** by the Python script to a floating-point range, usually **-1.0 to 1.0**.
  - For steering, -1.0 means full left, 0.0 is center, and 1.0 is full right.
  - For throttle, 1.0 means full forward, 0.0 is stop, and -1.0 means full reverse (the sign might be inverted depending on joystick orientation).

### 4. Sends PWM Commands (via `adafruit_pca9685`) ‚û°Ô∏è

- The Python script then uses the `adafruit_pca9685` library to send commands over the **I2C bus** to the appropriate PCA9685 PWM driver based on the mapped control values.

### 5. PCA9685 Generates PWM Signals ‚öôÔ∏è

**For Steering:** The PCA9685 at I2C address `0x40` receives the command for the steering angle. It generates a precise **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal** on its **Channel 0 (CH0)**, which is dedicated to the steering servo. The width of this pulse determines the servo's position.

**For Throttle:** The PCA9685 at I2C address `0x60` receives the command for motor speed/direction. It generates PWM signals on the channels connected to the **H-Bridge** (e.g., CH0_PWM, CH1_PWM, CH2_EN, CH3_EN as per your diagram). These signals control the H-Bridge's operation.

### 6. Controls Steering Servo (Turns Left/Right) ‚Ü©Ô∏è

- The PWM signal from PCA9685 (`0x40`, CH0) is sent to the **steering servo**.
- The servo rotates its arm to the commanded angle, physically **turning the PiRacer's front wheels left or right**.

### 7. Controls DC Motors via H-Bridge (Forward/Backward) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

- The PWM signals from PCA9685 (`0x60`) are sent to the **H-Bridge**.
- The H-Bridge interprets these signals to control the **dual DC motors**, causing them to spin **forward or backward** at the commanded speed, moving the PiRacer accordingly.
